    <h2>Safety First, Always!</h2>
    <p>Greetings!</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Technological University of the Philippines in Manila, College of Industrial Education in Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Website. The site was developed to enhance ICT students' safety awareness, responsibility, and learning through an accessible and interactive virtual learning space.</p>
    <p>Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) is centered on maintaining students' well-being, welfare, and safety in school settings, particularly in workshops and laboratories where technical activities are conducted. This site aims to improve learning safety through more interesting, hands-on, and technology-oriented experiences.</p>
    <p>The site includes Safety Guidelines and Resources. Additionally, the site offers an Engagement Tracker and Feedback Page, which are two of several tools aimed at fostering participation and personal reflection. Moreover, the design of the site/user experience brings the whole idea of safety being a collective effort in our educational community.</p>
